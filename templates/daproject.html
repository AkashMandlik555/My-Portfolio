    <h2>Data Analytics Projects.</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! I am passionate about Data Analysis and have worked 
        on several exciting projects in this field. My Data Analytics projects encompass a wide
         range of applications, from data analytics and making excellent visualization to 
         predictive analytics. I have developed models that can accurately classify and predict
          outcomes based on complex datasets. Each project showcases my ability to
           leverage data-driven insights to solve real-world problems. I am constantly expanding my
            knowledge and exploring innovative approaches to stay at the forefront of this
             rapidly evolving field. Feel free to explore my projects and see how I harness
              the power of data to drive meaningful results</p>
